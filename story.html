    This is a story about camaraderie. The story is about teachers. It starts in
        a distant dukedom on a toxic world. The story begins with a premonition. 
        The fallout from the cold war plays a major role in this story.

    <p> It is a beautiful day - the Friday before a nice weekend - and all the
        world had its eyes on Seattle. What might that amazing city do

    <p> This may have to be the last update on the story - so here we go: "Everyone 
        had a happy ending!" THE END </p>
    
    <p> Looks like we can add a post-script: "So all the characters decided to meet again
        at the same place, same time, next year!". </p>cc
